Code Running Instructions:


1) open the "Image_Type_Input_Highway_DQN.ipynb" file for image input type DQN of Highway
2) open the "Observation_Input_highway.ipynb" file for observation input type DQN of Highway
3) open the "Model_based_learning_parking.ipynb" file for Model based learning for parking
4) Open the file in jupyter notebook and run the kernal cells. 
3) In the main algorithm the results will be displayed in a window for each iteration.
